In the heatmap above, we can see the density of the visits of all tourists belonging to the <i>Around Tuscany</i> cluster. The darker the colour, the more Around Tuscany visited that municipality during the pre-summer season (May 2017). As we can see from the  heatmap, the majority of the tourists from  this cluster visited Firenze (160.0% of the tourists in this cluster). The next most visited municipalities are Rignano sull'Arno (105.0%), and Reggello (92.0%). Besides the heatmap, in the plot above we can see four examples of trajectories of tourists who belong to the Around Tuscany cluster.
