In the last pre-summer season (May 2017) roughly 4 thousand tourists visited Tuscany from China. The data shows us 2 clusters. Each line in the graph above represents a cluster's typical path that tourists from China followed. These paths are displayed as differently-coloured lines in the map here above. 
The first cluster, which we named Around Tuscany, spends on average 2.9 days in Italy, 2.5 of which in Tuscany. When in Tuscany, Around Tuscany spend at least a half day in Florence.
