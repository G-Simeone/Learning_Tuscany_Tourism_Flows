In the heatmap above, we can see the density of the visits of all tourists belonging to the <i>Coastal Trips</i> cluster. The darker the colour, the more Coastal Trips visited that municipality during the pre-summer season (May 2017). As we can see from the  heatmap, the majority of the tourists from  this cluster visited Firenze (6.0% of the tourists in this cluster). The next most visited municipalities are San Gimignano (4.0%), and Pisa (4.0%). Besides the heatmap, in the plot above we can see four examples of trajectories of tourists who belong to the Coastal Trips cluster.
