In the heatmap above, we can see the density of the visits of all tourists belonging to the <i>Tuscany Trips</i> cluster. The darker the colour, the more Tuscany Trips visited that municipality during the post-summer season (Sep - Nov, 2017). As we can see from the  heatmap, the majority of the tourists from  this cluster visited San Gimignano (93.0% of the tourists in this cluster). The next most visited municipalities are Firenze (89.0%), and Poggibonsi (70.0%). Besides the heatmap, in the plot above we can see four examples of trajectories of tourists who belong to the Tuscany Trips cluster.
