In the heatmap above, we can see the density of the visits of all tourists belonging to the <i>Around Florence</i> cluster. The darker the colour, the more Around Florence visited that municipality during the post-summer season (Sep - Nov, 2017). As we can see from the  heatmap, the majority of the tourists from  this cluster visited Firenze (24.0% of the tourists in this cluster). The next most visited municipalities are Pisa (19.0%), and Livorno (14.0%). Besides the heatmap, in the plot above we can see four examples of trajectories of tourists who belong to the Around Florence cluster.
