# Models

## K-means
Our persona analysis groups tourists based on their interests, such as which cities and attractions they visited in Tuscany. We clustered tourists in the pre-summer and summer season based on time-space and behavioural features, using k-means clustering, Our optimal solution revelaed 4 clusters in both cases. 

### How to run it?

1) Import the description library, which imports the clustering library too
```python
import sys
r_path_data = "../src/utils/descriptive_engine/"
sys.path.append(r_path_data)
from descriptives import *
```

1) Import the library:
```python
import sys
sys.path.append("..")
from connect_db import db_connection
```

2) Import config file:
```python

5) Generate description

```python
"""

## Sequence analysis

Trajectory analysis finds the most frequent paths among tourists. We clustered a set of different nationalities in different seasons purely based on touristsâ€™ individual spatial trajectories or sequences categorised by location  (eg: Florence -> Pisa -> Livorno ) We used optimal matching to to compute distances between sequences (cost of insertion, deletion and substitution to match two sequences) and the resulting distance matrix was clustered by the k-medoids algorithm. This clustering methodology takes into account timing (e.g: When does a tourist visit Florence), Duration (e.g: How long does a tourist stay in Florence) and order (e.g: Where did they come from and where do they go next) to create the clusters of trajectories. 

### How to run it?



## Geo2Vec

Location clustering shows which municipalities in the region are visited together during the same trip. The location clustering is done with a combination of the geo2vec model and the k-means clustering algorithm. The geo2vec model creates an embedding matrix based on some training data (in our case, ordered sequences of municipalities visited by tourists during a trip that included Tuscany), which contains a vector of a given dimension for each of the municipalities in Italy. These vectors are then clustered in a given number of clusters. Each of these clusters contain municipalities that are commonly visited in the same trip. This approach was inspired by a previous implementation of listing embeddings for a recommendations website, and relies on the implementation of a famous natural language processing algorithm, [word2vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec). 

### How to run it?

#### Example
The model can be run once by executing the `run_single.py` script (alternatively, you can run `location_clustering.py` in the `pipeline` folder). The script does the following:

1) Loads the parameters from a given config file

2) Load the preprocessing module and preprocess/filter the data
```python
"""
Parameters:
season: names of the season used for clustering
country: name of the country (all=all countries)
MIN_LENGHT: minimum number of municipalities in a single trip

Returns an txt file saved to .../results/kmeans/country_season/country_season.html
"""

sys.path.append("../src/utils/geolocation/")
import preprocessing

if country == 'all':
    df_trips = load_df.get_geo2vec_data_all_country(username, season).rename(columns={'com_locs_trunc':'locations'})
else:
    df_trips = load_df.get_geo2vec_data(username, season, country).rename(columns={'com_locs_trunc':'locations'})
        
preprocessing.str_to_list(df_trips)
df_trips_red = preprocessing.filter_short_trips(df_trips, min_length=MIN_LENGTH)
```

3) Load shape files

```python
sys.path.append("../src/utils/")
from load_data import load_dataframes as load_df

path_shapefiles, regions, provinces, territories, municipalities, crs = read_files.read_shapefile_data(path_to_shapefiles, 'shape_files_path.json')
df_mun_tus = read_files.read_shapefiles_in(True, path_shapefiles, municipalities, crs)
```
4) Initialize and run the geo2vec model

```python

 g2v = Geo2vec(EMB_SIZE, WINDOW_SIZE, season, country)
 # initialize model
 g2v.initialize(sequences=df_trips_red['locations_list'], min_count=MIN_COUNT)
 # train model
 if train_model:       
     g2v.train(df_trips_red['locations_list'], n_epochs=N_EPOCHS)
```

5) Do the clustering

```python
 # cluster model
 g2v.create_clusters(n_clusters=N_CLUSTERS)
```

6) Plot the clusters in the Tuscany map

```python
if plot_clusters_tuscany:
    print('\nTUSCANY -- plotting...\n\n')
    g2v.merge_gdf(df_mun_tus)
    g2v.get_most_similar()
    g2v.pickle_cluster_labels(tag='Tuscany')   
    plt_loc(g2v.gdf_clusters,
            path_to_file=path_to_final_plots+'{}_{}/'.format(country, season),
            file_name='Location_cluster_Tuscany_EMB{}_WIN{}_EPO{}_CLU{}_MinL{}_MinC{}.html'.format(EMB_SIZE, WINDOW_SIZE, N_EPOCHS, N_CLUSTERS, MIN_LENGTH, MIN_COUNT))
```
