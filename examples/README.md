# Example notebooks for the three models

Example notebooks with code and basic outputs for:
- persona clustering (`k_means_example.ipynb`)
- sequence clustering (`sequence_analysis_examples.ipynb`)
- location clustering (`geo2vec_examples.ipynb`)
    - See sample_location_trips_summer_Germany.csv as an example for data structure required for the location clustering model.

## How to run the notebooks?

To run the notebooks, the conda environment and Jupyter Notebooks should be installed with Python 3.6<, and all packages at `../requirements.txt`. To set up a conda environment, see ['setting up the environment'](https://github.com/dssg/TPT_tourism/blob/master/README.md)
