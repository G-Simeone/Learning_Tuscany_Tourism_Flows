--- Adding weighted average and standard deviation of latitudes and longitudes of tower locations which
--    each customer was connected to; latitude and longitude of the tower to which each customer was connected 
--    in the first instance, the last instance, and for the longest time in the customer_feature table

---     avg_lat: Average of the latitudes of all towers each customer was connected to, weighted by duration of connection
---     avg_lon: Average of the longitudes of all towers each customer was connected to, weighted by duration of connection
---     top_lat: Latitude of the tower to which each customer is connected for the longest time
---     top_lon: Longitude of the tower to which each customer is connected for the longest time
---     std_lat: Standard deviation of the latitudes of all towers each customer was connected to
---     std_lon: Standard deviation of the longitudes of all towers each customer was connected to
---     start_lat: Latitude of the tower to which each customer is connected for the first instance
---     start_lon: Longitude of the tower to which each customer is connected for the first instance
---     end_lat: Latitude of the tower to which each customer is connected for the last instance
---     end_lon: Longitude of the tower to which each customer is connected for the last instance
